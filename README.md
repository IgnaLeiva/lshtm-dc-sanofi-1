### How do hospitalisations as a result of the tri-demic of RSV, influenza and SARS-CoV-2 in the 2022 post-pandemic season compare to the 2016 - 2019 pre-pandemic circulation of RSV and influenza?

- Include analyses of different geographical locations (e.g. Northern/Southern hemisphere) and by age group.

Potential secondary questions: 
- Would the assessment be different if burden is disaggregated by hospitalisations vs. laboratory confirmed cases?
